SLF4J - Simple Logging Facade for Java
--------------------------------------

"The Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) is intended to serve as a simple
facade for various logging APIs allowing to the end-user to plug in the desired 
implementation at deployment time. SLF4J also allows for a gradual migration 
path away from Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL)."
