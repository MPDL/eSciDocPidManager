Package util.concurrent
-----------------------

"This package provides standardized, efficient versions of utility classes 
commonly encountered in concurrent Java programming. This code consists of 
implementations of ideas that have been around for ages, and is merely intended
to save you the trouble of coding them. Discussions of the rationale and 
applications of several of these classes can be found in the second edition of 
Concurrent Programming in Java."
